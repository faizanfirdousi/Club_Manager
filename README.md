College Clubs & Events Management Platform

Description:
Create a platform to streamline the management of college clubs and events.
The system will allow students to join clubs, stay updated on events, and
manage memberships, while club administrators can organize events, handle
registrations, and track member participation.

Abstract:
College clubs and events are an integral part of student life, but managing them
often involves juggling multiple tools and platforms. The College Clubs & Events
Management Platform aims to bring everything into one place, providing students
and administrators a unified platform for joining clubs, organizing events, and
tracking participation. The platform will foster better engagement among students
and create an organized environment for event management.
